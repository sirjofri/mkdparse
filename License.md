# License (mkdparse by sirjofri)

You are free to use this software for whatever you want, but please look at the following points.

- You are **allowed** to send me a gift if you like.
- You are **allowed** to send the whole package to someone else, unchanged and as it is.
- You are **allowed** to extract the `mkd.js` file, as long as you provide this license information somewhere.
- You are **allowed** to use portions of the code for whatever you like.
- You are **not allowed** to receive money for this software package alone. You need to at least change something.
- In case you change something: Leave the license information in the header of the file and change the "Author" to "Original Author".
- If you do that with some bigger portions (not one- or two-liners) please leave a note with a link (a comment in the code is enough)
- The software is not heavily tested. Please do not use it under weird circumstances (like: hanging on the international space station searching for the key you lost)
- Don't complain if this software kills your cat, dog or cow!
